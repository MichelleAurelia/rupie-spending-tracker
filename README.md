This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Setup

The database is powered by Supabase (PostgreSQL). Schema migrations are located in `supabase/migrations/`.

To apply the initial schema:
1. Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard.
2. Paste the contents of [`supabase/migrations/001_init.sql`](./supabase/migrations/001_init.sql) and run it.

### Schema Overview:
- **`profiles`**: Stores per-user settings (`display_name`, `monthly_income`, `payday_day`). Automatically created upon user sign-up via an `auth.users` trigger.
- **`expenses`**: Tracks user spending events (`amount`, `category`, `spent_at`, `note`, `rating`, `rated_at`).
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on both tables with strict per-user policies (`USING (auth.uid() = ...)` and `WITH CHECK`) ensuring users can only read and write their own data.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
